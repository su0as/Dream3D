## Overview

This project aims to transform 2D home images into stunning 3D isometric houses that can be viewed in web, AR, or VR environments. We utilize advanced techniques and tools to make this conversion process seamless and accessible.

## Key Features

- **Key Reference Points Identification (KRPI):** Our system intelligently identifies key reference points within your 2D image, ensuring accurate conversion.

- **Spatial Relationship Analysis (SRA):** Analyzing the spatial relationships of reference points is crucial for creating a realistic 3D representation.

- **3D Conversion using Control Net (CN):** We employ a control net to perform the conversion from 2D to 3D, resulting in an isometric house.

- **Stable Diffusion (SD):** The stable diffusion algorithm refines the 3D model, enhancing its quality and detail.

- **Replicate.com Integration (RC):** We leverage Replicate.com's machine learning capabilities to further enhance the 3D conversion process.

- **3D Viewer (Web/AR/VR):** Experience your 3D isometric house in web browsers or immersive AR and VR environments.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with our 2D to 3D conversion:

1. Provide your 2D home image as input.
2. Our system will identify key reference points.
3. Spatial relationships will be analyzed.
4. The 3D conversion process will commence.
5. Stable diffusion and Replicate.com integration will enhance the 3D model.
6. Finally, view your 3D isometric house in web, AR, or VR.
